# Battleship Game in Python
A simple implementation of the classic game Battleship in Python. The game is singe-player, it's played against "computer" randomly quessing the locations for your ships. This was made a while back as a project for a course on Basics of Programming.

The game is played on a 10x10 grid, where each player places their ships and takes turns firing missiles to sink the other player's ships. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins.

The program is commented and written with Finnish terms. The rules and the game can be found at `saannot.txt` and `harjoitustyo_v3.0.py` respectively. The file `parhaatTulokset.txt` is used to keep track of top scores.
